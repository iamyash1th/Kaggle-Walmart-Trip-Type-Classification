# Kaggle-Walmart-Trip-Type-Classification
The objective is to categorize shopping trip types based on the attributes of a purchase. To give a few hypothetical examples of trip types: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes. In this data, trips are categorized into 38 distinct types using a Walmart proprietary method applied to an extended set of data. Achieving similar trip types by categorizing/ clustering the data with a more limited set of features forms the crux of the problem.
